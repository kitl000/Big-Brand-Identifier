#Action on Google Extension

The purpose of this extension is to show how reputable a brand is using the
Google Knowledge Graph API. It allows users to get a ranked list of the most notable entities that match certain criteria. This is conveyed as a numeric value for the EntitySearchResult property resultScore. 

Creating this extension is a part of my Continuous Improvement Program for Accenture. My team lead has kindly provided me with his code for the above functionality. The task here is to convert the working HTML file into a Chrome extension with appropriate styling.


I first used my codes from my previous project, the Knowledge Graph Search Widget to create the base for this project. Next, an extension template from the official Developer Google Chrome documentation was added to give me an idea of how a chrome extension is suppose to look.
