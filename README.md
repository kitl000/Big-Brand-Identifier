#Action on Google Extension

The purpose of this extension is to show the how big a brand is using the
Google Knowledge Graph API. It allows users to get a ranked list of the most notable entities that match certain criteria. This is conveyed as a numeric value for the EntitySearchResult property resultScore. 

The extension was first created with the codes from my previous project, the Knowledge Graph Search Widget. Next, an extension template from the official Developer Google Chrome documentation was added as the base of our project.
